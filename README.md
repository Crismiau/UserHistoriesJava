# 🛍️ MiniStore - Java Project  

## 📖 Description  
MiniStore is a simple Java application that simulates a small store.  
It allows users to add products, manage stock, make purchases, and view statistics using **Swing dialogs (JOptionPane)** for interaction.  

The project is designed as a practice exercise for **data structures**, **loops**, and **basic GUI dialogs** in Java.
